# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

## Analysis Overview
Pewlett Hackard has numerous employees who are eligible to retire soon. The company has not had a good database of employee data. The purpose of this analysis was to learn by department and role how many employees will be retiring soon so the HR department can start hiring for these roles to train and backfill them. 

## Results
Included in this analysis you'll find four outputs:
- The retirement_titles.csv file has the employees who are eligible to retire and their current and former titles along with dates they started each position.
- The unique_titles.csv includes the employees eligible to retire, but just includes their current title.
- The retiring_titles.csv is the most important file to look at and includes a count of all the titles that eligible retirees currently hold. 
- We also ran the numbers on which employees are elibible to mentor new employees and the names along with their current tiles are included in the mentorship_eligibilty.csv file.

In the queries folder you will also see the SQL used in this analysis. This can be saved and used later to perform this analysis on an annual basis so the company can do a better job of planning to hire for retiring employees - focus on mentioring programs, etc.

## Summary
The findings from this analysis are as follows:

- From the table below the majority of the roles that need to be filled soon are engineers, senior engineers, staff and senior staff.

- Roughtly 1500 staff are eligible for a mentorhsip program. However, these numbers are small in comparison to the need. For example, there are 437 staff who could be mentored to senior staff, but there are 12,243 staff positions needed in total, so a mentoring program will not put much of a dent in the overall required staffing needs. In other words, there are not enough retirement-ready employees in the departments to mentor the next generation. My recommendation is to focus energies on hiring staff at the right levels and implement a scalable onboarding program. Perhaps you could leverage the mentorship employees to build a program.
